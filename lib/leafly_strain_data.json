Snoop\u2019s Dream is a mix of Blue Dream and Master Kush, which are purportedly two of the rapper\u2019s favorites. Looks-wise, these plants and flowers take after their Blue Dream parent with medium-sized dense buds covered in orange hairs. The taste is where the kush side of this strain shows itself. Sweet blueberry flavors are there with a pine aftertaste that takes over. This potent strain has strong effects that\u00a0may make doing any focused task difficult. Head effects can also be strong, making this a choice that beginners might want to work up to.\u00a0",

    "description": "Sour Tsunami is a strain that became famous for being one of the first to be specifically bred for high CBD rather than THC content. The result is a strain that\u2019s effective at treating pain and inflammation without producing a significant \u201chigh\u201d that is linked to high THC. Lawrence Ringo of the Southern Humboldt Seed Collective bred this strain over four years of hard work by crossing Sour Diesel plants with NYC Diesel. This sativa-dominant hybrid flowers within 9 weeks, producing dense, dark green buds with dark green and purple-tinged leaves. The buds have a familiar musky diesel smell with sweet undertones.",
